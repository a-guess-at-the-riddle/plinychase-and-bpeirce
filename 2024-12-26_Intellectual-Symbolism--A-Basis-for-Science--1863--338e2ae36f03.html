But the tendency to inquiry is so natural, that any attempt to resist or suppress it will not only always prove futile, but it will even stimulate curi­osity to an increased activity, which may be exerted in secret, and therefore, with greater danger of leading the investigator into pernicious error.</p><p name="ab6a" id="ab6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those who discourage the discussion of religious or other dogmas, not only act in direct opposition to Paul’s precept to the Thessalonians, “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good,” but their action may be unwittingly instrumental in spreading the very evil that they wish to remove. Their opponents charge them at once with fearing investigation, and the plausibility of the charge often enlists the ardent sympathies of youthful inquirers, inducing them to listen to subtle reasonings that are cloaked in a fallacy too skillfully woven for them to unravel, and the fear of opprobrium deters them from discussing the arguments with those who might easily expose the fallacy.</p><p name="593e" id="593e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">True faith and true reason are handmaidens, — reason acknowledging its dependence on faith as the source of its authority, and faith demanding the assent of reason to no absur­dities, — however important it may regard a belief in the mysterious and the incompre­hensible. Both faith and reason may be often strengthened by the study of mysteries, and by forming such dim conceptions of their significance as may be traced in their faint shadowings, while both will be surely weakened if they become entirely self-reliant.</p><p name="e617" id="e617" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A fondness for philosophy is, then, fit cause for rejoicing, provided the spirit of inquiry is rightly guided. It is easy to show that no dictum of reason can be depended on as true, unless it can be traced to an infallible source, and that source can be none other than a Perfect Intelligence. All knowledge must, therefore, ultimately rest on revelation; the general knowledge of the race on a general revelation, and the special knowledge that may be adapted to newly arising needs of human liberty, on a special revelation. The question of faith, therefore, should not be, “Is this teaching perfectly comprehensible?” or “Is it such as unaided reason could have demonstrated for itself?” but “Is it such as the teacher knew to be true?”</p><p name="a034" id="a034" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although all knowledge rests ultimately on direct revelation, it is modified and ex­tended by faculties whose proper use may be regarded as a secondary or mediate revela­tion, and no satisfactory pursuit of knowledge is possible, without determining the extent, validity, and limitation of those faculties. On this account, Philosophy should begin with the study of Consciousness, and that study, like any other, may be most satisfactorily pur­sued, if it is pursued systematically. All system rests on laws of thought, and all laws imply relation. Relation may, therefore, be reasonably assumed as the natural basis of mental classification, and in the following pages I have attempted to show that a broad and comprehensive system may be developed from the necessary sequences of relation.</p><p name="9526" id="9526" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That the system as yet is far from complete, and that its present crude deductions will prove in many respects unsatisfactory, I am fully aware. One of the first teachings of faith is, as has been intimated, that the human Consciousness is not on the highest plane, but that the validity of its dicta rests on the infallibility of a higher Divine Consciousness, of which it is a faint and imperfect reflection. It is the instrument of philosophical investigation, but it can give us no information, except of that which is modified by its own relations. Parallel with it there may, perhaps, be always an accompanying Moral Inspi­ration, and an Active Genius, which bear to it relations similar to those of Motivity and Spontaneity to Rationality, but the province of these hypothetical parallel faculties we can never hope to investigate except through Analogy.</p><p name="1ea5" id="1ea5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Generalization is always necessarily superficial, yet it often leads to the most satisfactory results. The very fact of its superficiality relieves memory from a heavy burden, and facilitates the use of symbols, by which the labors of reasoning and investigation are greatly abbreviated.</p><p name="ed9a" id="ed9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whatever originality there may be in the symbolism by which I have endeavored to indicate the broadest of all possible generalizations, will naturally excite some degree of interest, but the final verdict as to its merits will rest on the answer to the old question, — ­<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Cui bono?</em> To that question I dare not yet attempt to give or to seek a full response. If the system is, as I most fully believe, grounded on the eternal necessities of truth, it cannot be altogether insignificant, neither can it degenerate into a toy, fit only for the amusement of idle curiosity.</p><p name="6c97" id="6c97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It may be said, indeed, that a mere notation can lead to no discoveries in Mental Science. This is in one sense true, but may not the same be said with equal, nay, with greater propriety, of the different notations of Mathematics, Logic, and Chemistry? The arbitrary signs of Algebra and the Calculus, do not contain in themselves the elements of any new truth, but they furnish a concise and precise language, by means of which, the results of a long process of investigation may be briefly expressed, and employed as the basis for new researches. A system of symbols that should render similar aid to Ethical, Social, and Intellectual Science, could hardly fail to yield important advantages.</p><p name="dee5" id="dee5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A symbol in any case is not to be regarded as a box or wrapper in which some valuable but unknown truth is hidden, but it may be properly employed to represent, in the simplest possible form, an analysis that has already been made, and to keep the pure, unmixed results of that analysis so steadily in view, that they may be most conveniently used to facilitate farther investigation. Thus, although the Intellectual Symbols can convey very little meaning, until they are interpreted in familiar language, our operations with them may possibly lead us to reflect upon relations that had never before been observed, and by the study of these relations, new discoveries may be made.</p><p name="b263" id="b263" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I am right in supposing the eternal necessity of an entity of the same order as Space and Time, for which I have proposed the name of Position,* (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">See Chapter XII</em>). the steps which led to its discovery, will well illustrate my meaning. Many have supposed “formal conditions of experience,” or “logical antecedents of phenomena,” different from Space and Time, but in every instance that has fallen under my notice, those conditions or antecedents have had either a subjective coloring, or a concrete reference. Take, for example, the ideas of personality, substance, cause, finitude, and figure. If there had never been manifestation, it is difficult to conceive either their necessary or their possible existence. But even if we suppose manifestation to be annihilated, Space, Time, and Position would still remain.</p><p name="cdaa" id="cdaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since most, if not all our ideas of the Objective are derived from the material world, and our ideas of the Subjective from our own activity and its results, the necessary involution of space in the former, and of time in the latter, must have been evident to the earliest philosophical observers. But the necessity of a third form could never appear, until either the necessary triplicity of relativity, or the essential difference of relation from both the subjective and the objective, was perceived. The study of relativity led me to seek for the third formal condition, under which alone its triplicity was possible. Of my success in defining that condition by the sphere that I have assigned to Position, I must leave others to judge.</p><p name="23f4" id="23f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The following development would have been more entirely self-consistent, and for that reason it would, perhaps, have recommended itself to a more immediate and general approval, if it had stopped on the second plane below Consciousness, limiting its analysis to the determination of the three primary and nine secondary faculties. It would even then have covered a wider psychological field than has ever before been embraced in any systematic classification, — a field nearly as extensive as has ever been explored by any purely empirical philosophy. But I felt that it was desirable to indicate the direction of possible future discoveries; by a tentative analysis, that claims validity for none of its hypotheses, but seeks only to awaken an interest and stimulate an inquiry that may either verify or correct those hypotheses.</p><p name="220b" id="220b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Still, if the success of this tentative analysis be judged by a comparison with previous attempts of a similar character, and not by a reference to the standard of absolute and necessary truth, it will, perhaps, be deemed sufficient to increase and justify the interest which may be first awakened by the mere novelty of the system. That the first Essay should fail of giving complete satisfaction in all its details is not strange, for the more minute the special subdivisions of any classification become, the slighter will be their distinguishing shades of difference, the more numerous and marked their various points of resemblance, and consequently, a greater degree of critical skill, and a more profound knowledge will be requisite, in order to make such an assignment of species as will stand every test of subsequent discovery. But if the fear of imperfection discourages us from using the resources at our command, we shall not only fall short of perfection ourselves, but we shall retard the progress of those who are to follow us, by neglecting to take the first steps which are necessary for all progress.</p><p name="fcff" id="fcff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The spread of truth does not extinguish skepticism, but only banishes it to a remoter field. As the infinite limits the finite, so may the boundless realm of the doubtful and unknown be regarded as the limit of faith. The man who aims at a positive philosophy which shall embrace nothing that he does not understand, — refusing to accept anything on mere faith, — if he is consistent, will doubt everything, and even his boasted reason will be of no avail. But such consistency is fortunately impossible, for all are obliged practically to exercise a degree of faith which they often theoretically deny. Question closely and perseveringly as we may, we all finally arrive at simple truths that are accepted with implicit faith, not because our own authority is supreme, but because the clear perception of truth has been given us by the Supreme.</p><p name="fca4" id="fca4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Any one who fully recognizes the relativity of Consciousness, and the correlations that it necessarily implies, will not only find absolute skepticism or atheism impossible, but by the very necessity that he discovers for revelation, he will be prepared to seek for the evidences of such revelation, and to consider favorably the arguments by which it is supported. If such a state of mind is more desirable than the carping, self-sufficient spirit, that scorns all external mental illumination, and tests the sunlight of eternal verities by the dim glimmer of its own flickering taper, I may reasonably ask for friendly criticisms on an attempt to determine some of the primary laws of relation, as well as for the cooperation of those who are interested in the development of those laws, and the determination of their consequences.</p></div></div></section><section name="f203" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="60fd" id="60fd" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Chapter I.</h3><h4 name="dd83" id="dd83" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Definitions and Fundamental Relations.</h4><p name="6f92" id="6f92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1.</strong> Sᴄɪᴇɴᴄᴇ is knowledge based on belief; Fᴀɪᴛʜ is belief based upon revealed knowledge.*</p><p name="587b" id="587b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2.</strong> Every object of human inquiry is an object either of Science or of Faith.</p><p name="afa2" id="afa2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3.</strong> Belief is either absolute or relative.</p><p name="972a" id="972a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4.</strong> Absolute belief is fundamental, simple, primary, necessary, independent, and irresistible.

The same truth was more faintly shadowed forth in the “know thyself” of the Greek schools, but Descartes gave to the idea a clearness, simplicity, and fecundity of expression, that have revolutionized all metaphysical investigations.</p><p name="9f19" id="9f19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">16.</strong> All knowledge, therefore, starting from Intelligence, is limited by the nature and laws of Intelligence, and every Science must rest for its foundation on the Science of Mind. The Science of Science, which embraces all possible knowledge, was dignified by Socrates with the name of Philosophy, or the love of wisdom.</p><p name="498b" id="498b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">17.</strong> The simplest possible form of division is dual, but in treating of the faculties or capacities of Mind, there has been a very general recognition of triplicity. From the days of Pythagoras, who recognized in the soul three elements, Reason (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">νοῦς</em>), Intelligence (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">φρήν</em>), and Passion (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">θυμός</em>)<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">*</em>, to those of Hegel, who finds the manifestations of the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Idee</em> in Soul, Consciousness, and Reason, a fundamental ternary division has been adopted, with a marvelous unanimity which I can account for only by supposing it either to have been taught among the esoteric mysteries that shadow forth some of the earliest direct revelations to our race, or to have been founded on some obscure and dimly seen necessity of things.</p><p name="ab65" id="ab65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">18.</strong> For every general tendency, it is reasonable to suppose that there is some natural cause, yet no such cause appears to have been assigned or suspected, for the preference of any special form in the arrangement and classification of mental phenomena. There must be a great degree of uniformity in the facts that are made the objects of our study, and it is the duty of the critical investigator, to search for the law of which that uniformity is typical. “Facts are the words of God, and we may heap them together endlessly, but they will teach us little or nothing till we place them in their true relations, and recognize the thought that binds them together as a consistent whole.”†</p><p name="bc91" id="bc91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">19.</strong> Among the many marvelous aphorisms of Aristotle, one of the most marvelous and productive is to be found in Book XI, Chap. XI, of his Metaphysics. “ That which is changed is changed either from a characteristic‡ into a characteristic, or from a non-characteristic into a characteristic, or from a characteristic into a non-characteristic. I call that a characteristic which is made known by affirmation, so that it is necessary that there should be three changes; for that from a non-characteristic into a non-characteristic is not a change.”</p><p name="a436" id="a436" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">20.</strong> On this view of the possible relations that can constitute the groundwork of propositions, the whole philosophy of Hegel appears to rest. He teaches “that everywhere the idea or notion appears first of all in its immediateness or intrinsic reality, that it then passes judgment upon itself, or becomes resolved into its opposite, and ultimately coalesces from out these antagonisms. From this very method results the whole structure or subdivision of the system. The Absolute, the being-thinking or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Idee</em>, has to pass through three momenta, and in the first place, to present itself as bare idea in and for itself. Secondly, in its differentiation or objective state, externality; and thirdly, as the idea that has returned from its externality into itself. In the first state, it is the purely logical <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Idee</em>, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">thinking process</em> taken in the stricter sense as such in and for itself; in the second, it is the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Idee</em> in its externality, or departure from itself into a temporospatial disjunctivity, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">i. e. nature</em>; and in the third, it is the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">mind</em> or intelligence.

Thus desire, sentiment, instinct, will, perception, judgment, are all employed with a two-fold meaning, — one subjective, and the other objective; and if there is no impropriety in applying the term judgment indiscriminately, to the faculty of judging and to the decision of that faculty, there can be none in using the term Energy to denote the faculty of acting for a fixed purpose, as well as to denote the action itself.</p><p name="78bd" id="78bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">69.</strong> Energy is variously defined by our principal lexicographers, as “power, inherent or exerted;” “force;” “vigor;” “operation;” “strength;” “efficacy;” “faculty.” An energetic man is equally energetic, whether he is active or at rest; he is one who has the faculty of intelligent and successful activity, which he may exercise, like his other faculties, at his own pleasure.</p><p name="907c" id="907c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">70.</strong> Energy, therefore, in ordinary philosophical diction, as well as by common usage, seems to involve,<br>⠀⠀⠀1.

And the same is the case, even when this object be a speech and communication addressed to us, — a word or discourse given us to extract its meaning.

We can only say that those convictions are irresistible, that they are in accordance with the intellectual nature given to us by the Creator, and as such we ground our faith upon them, as revelations from that Supreme Intelligence, “for whom are all things, and by whom are all things.” “The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding to the simple.”<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">*</strong></p><p name="364f" id="364f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">101</strong>.

It is not in our power, it is not in the power of our will to cause the reason to give us such or such a truth, or not to give us them. Independent of our will, reason intervenes, and when certain conditions are fulfilled, gives us, I might say, imposes upon us these truths. The reason makes its appearance in us, though it is not ourselves, and in no way can it be confounded with our personality. Reason is impersonal. Whence then comes this wonderful guest within us, and what is the principle of this reason which enlightens us, without belonging to us This principle is God, the first and the last principle of everything. Now when the faith of reason in itself is attached to its principle, when it knows that it comes from God, it increases not merely in degree, but in nature, by as much, so to say, as the eternal substances is superior to the finite substance in which it makes its appearance. Thus comes a redoubled faith in the truths revealed by the supreme reason in the shadows of time, and in the limitations of our weakness.”†</p><p name="8a9b" id="8a9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">103</strong>. Cousin quotes in illustration, the following passage from Fenelon: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Existence of God</em>, Part I, ch. 4, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Of Human Reason</em>. “ In truth, my reason is in myself, for it is necessary that I should continually turn inward upon myself in order to find it, but the higher reason, which corrects me when I need it, and which I consult, is not my own, it does not make a part of myself. Thus, that which might seem the most our own, and to be the very foundation of our being, I mean our reason, is that whlich least belongs to us, which we are to believe the most borrowed. We receive continually and at every moment, a reason superior to ourselves, just as we continually breathe an air which is not of ourselves, or as we constantly see the objects around us by the light of the sun, whose rays do not belong to our eyes. There is an internal school, where man receives what he can neither acquire himself, nor learn from other men who live by alms like himself. Where is this perfect reason which is so near me, and yet so distinct and different from me? Is it not God himself, the being for whom I am inquiring?”</p><p name="5c1c" id="5c1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">104</strong>. “ There are cognitions in the mind which are not contingent, — which are necessary, — which we cannot but think, — which thought supposes as its fundamental condition. These cognitions, therefore, are not mere generalizations from experience. But if not derived from experience, they must be native to the mind; unless on an alternative that we need not at present contemplate, we suppose with Plato, St. Austin, Cousin, and other philosophers, that Reason, or more properly Intellect, is impersonal, and that we are conscious of these necessary cognitions in the Divine Mind. On the power possessed by the mind of manifesting those phenomena, we may bestow the name of the Regulative Faculty.

Besides these faculties there are, I conceive, no others; and in the sequel, I shall endeavor to show you, that while these are attributes of mind not to be confounded, — not to be analyzed into each other, — the other faculties which have been devised by philosophers are either factitious and imaginary, or easily reducible to these.”</p><p name="9e24" id="9e24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">107</strong>.

It is quite probable that some other order of classification may be more convenient for the lower faculties, but I have thought it would be best to show that the principle of trichotomy may be extended as far as the needs of science may require.</p></div></div></section><section name="1010" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="3942" id="3942" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Chapter IV.</h3><h4 name="3ba7" id="3ba7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">PHILOSOPHY OF CONSCIOUSNESS.</h4><p name="e50b" id="e50b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 127. </strong>Eᴠᴇʀʏ man feels that his personality does not consist in any peculiarity of form, feature, or complexion, any more than in the shape or texture of the clothes he wears. He finds his body with its limbs and organs of sense, a very convenient and important instrument for the execution of his plans, and he may take pride in the physical beauty, delicacy, or exquisite finish of that instrument, as he would in the symmetry of a horse, or the superior merit of anything else of which he claimed ownership. But the intelligent self, — the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Me</em>, — sits apart in such almost inaccessible majesty, that many have been accustomed to look upon it as a kind of mythical somewhat, whose very existence is exceedingly problematical, — a mere resultant, perhaps, of the material and physical organization. Such an opinion is of course based upon the assumption that the material is more patent and intelligible than the immaterial, — an assumption that it may be well to test by a brief inquiry into the chapter of our knowledge of the nature and qualities of mind.</p><p name="df07" id="df07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 128. </strong>Of the essential nature of mind or matter we know nothing. We can judge of them only by the effects they produce upon us by their properties or attributes. These attributes can be considered as belonging to them only in so far as they are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">phenomenal</em>, that is to say, as they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">appear</em> to our observation. What analogy or connection there may be between the phenomenal attributes and the substantial essence, it is impossible, for reasons that will appear in the course of our inquiry, for us to determine. It is, however, obvious that the phenomena of mind are more closely related to the observing mind, than the phenomena of matter. We ought therefore to know more of mind than of matter, and inasmuch as we, know nothing of matter except the effects it produces upon our minds, Bishop Berkely and others have attempted with much force and plausibility of argument, to prove that there is no real substantial existence, except of mind and its modifications.</p><p name="1026" id="1026" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 129. </strong>In the connection of attributes with the objects of our investigations, we observe different degrees of intimacy, some appearing inseparable and essential, while others are more or less accidental. Thus it is impossible for us to think of matter as divested of the property of impenetrability, but inertia, divisibility, weight, and color, seem less closely connected with it, — being as it were the mere clothing of impenetrability, — and a demonstration of the existence of matter in some form without either of these secondary qualities would not greatly surprise us.</p><p name="1c38" id="1c38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 130. </strong>The phenomenal rests on the absolute, and the metaphysical fashion, which can be donned or doffed at pleasure, must be dependent on the purely metaphysical investigations of thinkers, whose magnetic vigor can polarize the world of mind. The philosophical triumvirate that has ruled the last half century, — Fichte,<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">*</strong> Cousin, and Hamilton, differing as they do in many of the details of doctrine, and standing in clear individuality as legitimate representatives of the three great forms of modern civilized speech and thought, — all build upon the same foundation, and all agree in a profound rational Transcendentalism.† The pantheism of the German, the eclecticism of the French, and the practicalness of the English thinker, are but accidental appendages of their several systems, — cloaks that have indeed either set a local fashion, or been cut in a style already prevailing, but not the body or groundwork of their teachings. Each appeals for the confirmation of every truth, to a judge whose dicta are more authoritative than those of sensation or experience, and whether that judge be called The Life, Consciousness, or Common Sense, is a matter of small moment.</p><p name="0f61" id="0f61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 131. </strong>In the words of Fichte,‡ “ We see, hear, feel, outward objects; and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">along with </em>this seeing, &amp;c., we also <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">think</em> those objects, and are conscious of them by means of our inward sense, just as we are conscious by the same inward sense, of our seeing, hearing, and feeling of those objects. . . .

This fact of Consciousness does by no means contain any <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">relation</em> between . . the outward Sense and the inward Thought, . . as Cause and Effect, or as Essential and Accidental.

But should any one look deeper into the matter, . . inasmuch as the inward consciousness embraces even the outward sense itself; since we are conscious of the seeing, hearing, or feeling, but can by no means, on the other hand, see, hear, or feel our consciousness; and thus, even in the immediate fact, Consciousness assumes the higher place, — such an one, I say, would find it much more natural to make the internal Consciousness the chief thing, and the external Sense the subordinate thing; and to explaining the latter by the former; to control and try the latter by the former ; — and not the reverse.”</p><p name="3acd" id="3acd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 133. </strong>Either Cousin or Hamilton might have thus discoursed, for each of them maintains the supremacy and efficiency of Consciousness, — the subordination of Sensation, — and the relation of the latter as the chronological, to the former as its logical antecedent.

The pages of an ordinary Encyclopedia will show that in the earliest historical times, the Brahminical sages taught many of the leading doctrines that characterize some of the most distinguished modern philosophical schools. A cursory perusal of the works of Plato and Aristotle reveals the origin of so much of the variety and profundity of thought that later writers would gladly claim as their own, that one is tempted to exclaim with Solomon, “ there is nothing new under the sun,” and to believe that in what poor, weak, deluded humanity regards as the most exalted sphere of investigation, it is destined to move in a continual circle, making no real progress, but constantly repeating the ideas and systems of earlier ages.</p><p name="3071" id="3071" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 135. </strong>But if our metaphysical reading is more than superficial, much of this discouragement will vanish, giving place to a hope, if not to a full conviction, that the day will come when the science of all science* will assume a clearness and a definiteness such as it merits. Human nature has been the same in all ages, and it is therefore natural that the same questions should continually suggest themselves, and that they should receive the same answers, somewhat modified, perchance, by individual idiosyncrasies. The phenomena of mind are as patent to observation as those of matter, and prior to the days of Bacon, the former were more studied and better understood than the latter. It is true that in neither physical nor metaphysical science had much advance been made for many centuries, but in the entire absence of any system by which the acquirements of one age could be readily communicated to the next, how could any advance be anticipated? A life of investigation, however directed, should doubtless bring to light a mass of valuable truth, which might be recorded for the benefit of future investigators in the same field, but if the record shows no connecting thread of thought, which makes all the details parts of a consistent whole, it will be of little value.</p><p name="7fc6" id="7fc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 136. </strong>The study of isolated facts is dry, dull, tedious, and unprofitable, and even if the facts are arranged according to a merely arbitrary system, though their acquisition may be somewhat facilitated, it will yield but little satisfaction. A lifetime might be devoted to learning a dictionary by rote, but the learner would probably be little more skilful in the expression of his thoughts after his task was ended, than he was at its commencement. And in like manner the student who delves fur years in the fertile soil of Greek philosophy, will probably make no further progress than his predecessors, even if he accomplish as much as he would have done had he devoted himself to original and unassisted personal investigation. But let him bring to the study a natural system or plan, based upon eternal aid unchangeable ideas, — a plan by which all prior observations may be classified, and every fact may be arranged in its proper place, as aii illustration of the Divine Thought, — and it will be strange if he does not find much that had been mysterious, made suddenly intelligible, and difficulties that had seemed insurmountable, suddenly removed. The labors of modern metaphysicians have been principally valuable as tending to develop such a system.</p><p name="3a14" id="3a14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 137. [ </strong>The question has often been discussed, whether the Mind ever loses its consciousness. Though the full consideration of this inquiry would involve an investigation into the substantive nature of mind, and its full solution by us is therefore absolutely impossible, it is worthy of some attention, even if it yields no other result than a determination of the true position and dignity of Consciousness.</p><p name="0c5a" id="0c5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 138. </strong>In a sound, dreamless sleep, we give no external manifestation of intelligence or activity, and on awaking we have no recollection of any train of thought that has occupied our minds. But even in slumber the most profound, a loud noise, any application that causes physical pain, or a sudden change, whether of motion, temperature, position, or other external circumstances, gives manifest evidence that the internal watchman slumbers, but is at all times ready to receive any impressions that are sufficient to stimulate the wearied nerves into action.</p><p name="ab2d" id="ab2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 139. </strong>Consciousness has been sometimes regarded as only one of many distinct faculties of Mind, and an attempt has been made to show that mental operations are often carried on without our knowledge.<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">*</strong> It has been said, for instance, that when we are absorbed in a train of thought, we may hear a clock strike without being conscious of it, — or we may read long passages aloud without being conscious either of the matter or meaning of the author, or even of the exercise of our vocal organs. There are also authentic cases reported of soldiers marching, and of stenographers reporting evidence and debates while they were asleep, and therefore, it is said, in a state of entire unconsciousness.</p><p name="f0b5" id="f0b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 140. </strong>Such instances, however, are evidences only of forgetfulness more or less entire, and they tend rather to prove that Consciousness is always active even during the greatest physical torpor, than to show that it is ever wholly absent. The mind may be so fully absorbed that we do not hear the striking of a clock, but if we do hear it, we must at the moment know that we hear it, though it may produce so slight an impression that we may forget immediately afterwards whether we heard it or not. So in reading or writing, we must know at the time that we recognize the form of every word, though the words themselves convey to us no idea of their meaning, and leave no trace upon our memory. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">]</strong></p><p name="5cc1" id="5cc1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 141. </strong>As all scientific investigation should exclude from the field of its inquiry everything that is known to be beyond its reach, and everything that is merely speculative, we should, if possible, so limit the terms that we employ, as to confine our researches strictly to the territory that we may reasonably hope to explore. In accordance with this principle, the Natural Philosopher, because he cannot conceive of matter apart from impenetrability, inertia, and extension, defines matter as a substance impenetrable, inert, and extended. In like manner, as we cannot conceive of mind, either as possessed of any of the attributes of matter, or as devoid of consciousness, we may define it as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the form of immaterial substance, which is manifested in Consciousness</em>.<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">†</strong></p><p name="ecaf" id="ecaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 142</strong>. The acquisition of isolated facts is the earliest, easiest, and simplest form of progress in knowledge. These facts, as soon as they are appropriated, excite curiosity, or a desire to know more. This Curiosity is a stimulus to mental exertion.</p><p name="d50e" id="d50e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 143.</strong> Influenced by the awakened stimulus, the mind acts somewhat blindly and confusedly at first, yet sufficiently to show that it has in itself an inherent and independent power of action. In the simple exercise of his active powers, without any definite object or aim other than the gratification of a capricious will, the child finds an inexhaustible source of enjoyment.</p><p name="7a94" id="7a94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 144.</strong> As mental development proceeds, we become conscious of a higher power than that of mere activity, — the power of intelligence, which involves the comprehension of truths, relations, and laws.</p><p name="2572" id="2572" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 145.</strong> Hence we are naturally led to the study of Consciousness under three distinct<br>forms of manifestation:<br>⠀⠀⠀1. As a stimulus to exertion, acted upon by external influences. To this form of Consciousness we have given the name of MOTIVITY.<br>⠀⠀⠀2. As acting of its own accord, free from any extraneous impulse, and stimulated only by its own conscious Motivity. To this form of Consciousness we have given the name of SPONTANEITY.<br>⠀⠀⠀3. As operating intelligently for the discovery of truth. This third and highest form of Consciousness, to which Motivity and Spontaneity should be both subservient, we have called RATIONALITY.</p><p name="8c8d" id="8c8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 146.</strong> If this division is admitted as being founded in necessity, or even as being natural or appropriate, it is desirable that the respective limits of the three Conscious Forms should be clearly defined and understood, and that we should carefully avoid attributing to either, an influence which it does not properly possess.</p><p name="a49d" id="a49d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 147.</strong> We might for instance, naturally suppose that Motivity is subject to the direct supervision of Spontaneity and Rationality, and that therefore it may sometimes be subjective both in origin and tendency. Indeed, it may be asked, if our motives are not thus under our control, how is it possible to believe or imagine that we are in any way accountable for our actions ?</p><p name="1a77" id="1a77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 148.</strong> In answer to this question it may be remarked, that we rarely attach any sense of responsibility to our motives, but only to the acts themselves, so far as they are spontaneous or voluntary. All our motives are good, if they are not allowed an undue authority, and it is a part of the province of Spontaneity, aided by Rationality, to determine the amount of influence that we will accord to each. The question of responsibility does not concern creatures of blind fate or necessity, and it can have no reference to man so long as he is irresistibly impelled by any external force, but so soon as he is able to withstand the impulse, and he begins to deliberate, he becomes accountable. In the majority of cases we are urged by two or more motives acting simultaneously. We may for instance feel at the same moment, an inclination to physical exertion, a desire to employ that exertion in appropriating something to our owln use, and a conscientious conviction that the appropriation would be wrong, because the article desired is already the property of another. No blame can be attached to us for either of these three motives, but if our Spontaneity decides to act in accordance with the inclination and desire, and in opposition to the conscientious conviction, we shall feel self-condemned, and responsible for the improper exercise of Spontaneity.</p><p name="a2a8" id="a2a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 149.</strong> Motivity is blind, involuntary, impulsive,-Spontaneity should be always watchful, cautious, deliberate. Motivity is never subject to our control at the moment of action, or in other words, we can never dictate the character of the motives that shall suggest themselves to us on any given occasion. No man by any effort of will or reason, can inake the influence of all his motives such as he would like, or such as according to his rational convictions, it ought to be. If we desire to correct our errors, to reform our habits, or to alter our character, the proper way to effect the change, is by exposing Motivity to such objective influences as will tend to strengthen or weaken its particular manifestations.</p><p name="722e" id="722e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 150.</strong> Spontaneity and Rationality can act on Motivity only indirectly. If Spontaneity is sufficiently strong or deliberate to resist in a single instance, a motive which from indulgence has acquired undue strength, the motive will be weakened, and each new successful resistance will diminish its influence in a greater degree, until finally it will cease to operate improperly. In like manner, a motive that is too feeble, may be made efficient by a strong or deliberate volition, and by habitual exercise, it may be strengthened to any desirable extent. In these cases, Spontaneity does not act oni Motivity, but in its proper sphere of restraining our impetuosity, and calling upon Rationality to deliberate between our varying inclinations, it provides a way by which Motivity may receive the proper objective bias.</p><p name="058c" id="058c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 151.</strong> If Spontaneity is weak, so that under the influence of strong Motivity it becomes precipitate, virtuous sentiments and desires will still exist, however feeble, and Spontaneity may strengthen them,-increasing at the same time its own efficiency, — by forming the habit of deliberate circumspection, by avoiding temptation, and by seeking proper employment, suitable associates, and such other circumstantial aids as Rationality may suggest, or the sense of duty may indicate.</p><p name="f346" id="f346" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 152.</strong> It is doubtful whether there is ever any action of Spontaneity without a motive. In most cases, indeed, in all cases that involve any question of moral right or wrong, a variety of motives are presented in connection. If they all incline to the same course of procedure, Spontaneity will act instantaneously. If there is a conflict among them, Spontaneity has the power, and it should exercise the power of waiting for deliberation. If proper deliberation is used, its final action will scientious motive, and with the convictions of Rationality.</p><p name="1778" id="1778" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 153.</strong> In these powers of Spontaneity consists our Freedom of Will. We may not be free to act without motives, or contrary to our motives, or even contrary to the strongest motive. But we have the power of discerning in all cases which ought to be the strongest motive,-the power in most cases, of deliberating between conflicting motives, and delaying the too violent (and therefore vicious), until the feebler virtuous motive can assert its supremacy, thus determining which s8all be the strongest motive,-and the power of exposing ourselves to external influences that will operate on our Motivity for the formation of virtuous habits. For the proper exercise of these powers, we undoubtedly are, as we feel ourselves to be, responsible and accountable.</p><p name="8253" id="8253" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 154.</strong> As upon a cursory view, the action of Motivity sometimes seems to have a subjective origin, so may the tendency of Spontaneity often appear objective. Indeed, most of our actions are upon objects, — the very brain that we use as the organ of thought, the nerves that convey our physical volitions, and the muscles that serve as the instruments of our will, being objective when considered in their relations to the mind.</p><p name="640b" id="640b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 155.</strong> But the tendency and end of Spontaneity considered in itself, is merely our personal gratification. Considered simply as active beings, we are conscious of nothing but our activity, which is purely subjective. Rationality alone can take note of any external objects, or declare that our exertions produce any objective effect, and it is only because of the intimate connection of Rationality and Spontaneity, — part of the province of the latter, in aiding its own determinations, being to call for the decisions of the former, — that we could ever suppose Spontaneity to be, like Rationality, subjective-objective.</p><p name="6370" id="6370" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 156.</strong> We have said that Spontaneity should be deliberate. By this we mean that Spontaneity should call Rationality to its aid, on every occasion of conflicting motives. Deliberation is not one of the offices of Spontaneity, except iniasmuch as it involves the faculty of attention, but under the influence of the conscientious motive that declares the duty of deliberation, Spontaneity may become attentive, and excite Rationality to deliberate. Rationality is the judicial, Spontaneity the executive power. The former expounds and interprets laws that are based upon eternal necessity, and revealed by Divine Benevolence, — the latter, when in the proper performance of its functions, governs all its operations by those laws.</p><p name="dec0" id="dec0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 157.</strong> Here again we have another apparent tendency inconsistent with our principles. If Rationality decides, and Spontaneity acts according to the decision, it may appear that Rationality tends to determine the exercise of Spontaneity, and is therefore subjective-subjective. But if we reflect, we shall perceive that Spontaneity has determined, before appealing to the tribunal of Reason, to act in accordance with the motive which ought to be the strongest, according to the convictions of Rationality. Rationality makes its objective decision on the questions propounded to it by Spontaneity, and its office is then accomplished. Spontaneity makes use of the decision, and if its determination has not been changed in the meanwhile by a new intervention of Motivity, calling for a new exercise of its powers, it makes that the strongest, which might otherwise have been the weakest motive.</p><p name="58e2" id="58e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 158.</strong> The immediate origin of Rational action sometimes appears objective. In perception through the senses, if we regard Perception as a rational faculty, it is not always easy to perceive any intermediate action of Motivity or Spontaneity, between the physical impression upon the nerves, and the intelligent perception. But if we examine closely, we shall probably find that in every instance, the spontaneous faculty of attention is aroused, before any perception can take place.<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">*</strong> If the attention is wholly absorbed, pictures of passing objects may be painted upon the retina in the most glowing colors, the waves of sound from the most soul-thrilling melodies, may beat their tattoo on the drum of the ear, the pores of the sensitive skin may be closed by cold, or opened by sweltering heat, without exciting perception, the impression upon the consciousness being insufficient to divert the action of Spontaneity, so that Rationality may assign to the impression an objective validity. If amidst this absorption, we are suddenly startled, — as for instance, by a vivid flash of lightning, the near report of a cannon, or a violent blow, — we have first a confused consciousness of disturbance, to which succeed a motive desire to understand the cause of the disturbance, and a spontaneous act changing the direction of the faculty of attention, followed immediately by a rational objective perception.</p><p name="9dac" id="9dac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 159.</strong> In every instance of the recognition of a physical object, the process appears therefore to be, — first, an impression on the brain through the nerves, — second, if this impression is sufficiently strong, a simple and at first confused consciousness of that impression, exciting Spontaneity through the intervention of Motivity, — third, a rational perception of an object. Between the objective impression and the objective determination of Reason, an objective-subjective act must invariably and necessarily be interposed, otherwise the action would be merely objective-objective, and as such it would be entirely excluded from the sphere of Consciousness.</p><p name="efba" id="efba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 160.</strong> Because perception follows the impression on the sensitive nerves, without any apparent interval, it is not strange that we should think it impossible for any other mental operation to intervene. But when we observe the rapid movement of the fingers in a skilful pianist, or the marvellous facility of computation in an experienced accountant, and reflect that each motion, and each addition, requires a distinct volition, we may readily conceive that Motivity and Spontaneity may have time to act between the consciousness of the sensible impression, and the perception of the object from which that impression originated. And if we watch the earliest developments of the perceptive powers in an infant, we can liardly fail to be convinced that a desire to interpret the unknown affection of Consciousness, precedes every distinct perception. If we find such a precedence in but a single instance, it will furnish a strong presumption that the order we have indicated is the natural one, and that it is only because it is habitual, that we fail to detect it in every case.</p><p name="02f3" id="02f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 161.</strong> However philosophical the division of Consciousness into Motivity, Spontaneity, and Rationality may be, as a basis for the classification of the mental faculties, the division is one, as we have seen, that can never fall purely under our observation, but it is rather a rational determination a priori of necessary states, like our conception of matter, which is derived from the consideration of mixed and varying phenomena or qualities. Our ideas of the three Conscious-forms may however be made more distinct, definite, and adequate, than our ideas of matter or its primary attributes, and therefore the science of mind has a more impregnable foundation than that of matter. Whether upon that foundation a metaphysical superstructure will ever be erected, more beautiful and complete than our present congeries of physical sciences, is a question for the future to solve.</p><p name="2a01" id="2a01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 162.</strong> Consciousness is so far a rule to itself,-the mind is so multiform in its infinite<br>variety of capability, that we might plausibly demand even more latitude in our attempts at defining and comprehending its divers characteristics, than we so readily allow to every student of the more precisely marked forms of less versatile material nature. We have however no occasion for any such demand, for the science of mind, at least in its foundation, is not only more precise and definite, but it is also more substantial than that of matter. We use the term substantial in its primitive meaning, as indicating an approximation to the perception of that which underlies the phenomenal or accidental.

We may even ourselves, have sometimes regretted that subjects which seemed to us of the most vital importance, should be veiled in obscurity, and we must therefore rest our confidence in them, solely on the authority of others.

We must therefore recognize certain truths as self-evident; we have already discovered that there are such truths, truths that form the substratum of all our knowledge, and of all our belief, — the axioms of science. These axioms are not confined to mathematics, neither have mathematical axioms any greater certainty than any other self-evident truths. The axioms of our own existence, and of the existence of something independent of ourselves, have no mathematical characteristics, and yet they are as indubitable as the axiom that the whole is greater than a part. Every necessary conviction of the mind, every proposition that we receive unhesitatingly as true the moment we comprehend it, in other words, every self-evident truth, is incontrovertible, and every science that can be built upon such truths, and upon a correct perception of the relations that subsist between them, is a true science, and constitutes a portion of the absolute knowledge to which we are all capable of attaining.</p><p name="3045" id="3045" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 217. </strong>There is, then, in the nature of things, no reason why we may not have metaphysical sciences, as well as physical sciences, — sciences of mind, of morals, and of law, as well as sciences of number, of matter, and of form.

Long before we are able to express our thoughts, even before we know what it is to think, these busy observers are at work examining the objects around us, and storing our minds with the results of their examination. We are required by our very nature to place confidence in the information that they convey, and that confidence is never materially weakened by the experience of life, or by the arguments of theorists, who tell us we should not depend on the testimony of the senses, because they so often deceive us. Before we reflect at all on the distinctions of truth and falsehood, the sensual impressions have become indelible; they constitute, in fact, a part of our very being,-a reality that we can no more deny than we can deny our own existence. It is evident, therefore, that we can have no assurance with regard to any portion of our experience or belief without relying implicitly on these early impressions.</p><p name="4d9c" id="4d9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 219.</strong> That implicit reliance we all have; it is necessary, irresistible. No arguments ever have been adduced, and we may be assured that none ever can be adduced, to weaken it. We know that the testimony of our senses is true. We know that there is something without us that is capable of exciting certain impressions within us,-that there are real existences, certain qualities of which are cognizable by the sight, the feeling, the hearing, the smell, the taste. What is the nature of external objects, we have no means of knowing, and with our present faculties we shall probably never be able to ascertain. Much as we may dispute with regard to real essences, greatly as we may obscure and confuse our ideas by the attempt to prove that mind is but the result of organized matter, or that matter is but a mode of universal mind, we never in reality doubt that the external world has a real existence. The senses, therefore, are capable of furnishing us with positive knowledge.</p><p name="49e5" id="49e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 220.</strong> Prior, in all probability, to the reception of any external impression, there is an internal consciousness of being. It would seem almost necessary that the infant should know something of itself before it begins to perceive anything exterior to itself,-at least the power of perceiving must have an existence (and how can it exist without being known) before perception can take place. But waiving the question of priority as of comparatively little consequence, there are certainly facts of consciousness entirely independent of sensation.</p><p name="76fc" id="76fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 221.</strong> We have appetites, passions, desires, sentiments, clearly defined and readily distinguishable from each other.

Do we ever doubt their reality Do we ever feel that we may be mistaken in believing that we love or hate, that we fear or venerate, that we hope or despair? You answer, No, emphatically and without hesitation. We know that our own consciousness can never deceive us, and in that, at least, if nowhere else, may we find a sufficient refutation of the skeptical belief that we can be sure of nothing. We know that circumstances cannot affect the reality of our perceptions, that they neither weaken them nor exert any control over them.

We have a faculty that furnishes us with abstract ideas,-ideas neither of sense nor of consciousness, although they may be first suggested in connection with other truths as the necessary condition of those truths. For example, from sense we derive the idea of body, and in connection with the idea of body, reason at once suggests the necessary and absolute idea of space. Sense discovers the finite, reason mounts to the infinite. Sense perceives the succession of phenomena, reason teaches the relation of cause and effect</p><p name="4e08" id="4e08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 223.</strong> These ideas are all essentially distinct, and cannot be confounded with each other. We know that body could not exist without space; the finite without the infinite; the phenomenon without a cause; but we can easily conceive of space without body; of the infinite without any finite existence; of an efficient cause which has the power in itself of either manifesting its efficiency in action, or of remaining entirely at rest.</p><p name="9d84" id="9d84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 224.</strong> We know, also, that rational ideas cannot be derived from sense or from self-consciousness.

These relations, when they are plainly perceived, are seen to be unalterable, and founded in the necessity of things. Whatever may be the subject of our consideration, we proceed irresistibly from one conclusion to another, and we feel that from the same data every other rational being would have drawn the same inferences. The propositions of Geometry furnish the most evident proof of this fact, though the proof may be also found in every instance in which one truth is perceived as necessarily resulting from the relation of two or more truths which were previously known.</p><p name="ce0a" id="ce0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 226.</strong> Behold the three guides to knowledge, — the only three that we can possibly employ, the three within whose province lies the whole territory of conceivable or possible truth.

Distinct, and yet working in entire harmony with each other, they have each a separate and equally important office; the decisions of each in its appropriate sphere are equally reliable. We have seen that this is true in the few instances which have been adduced; and if we extend our inquiries faithfully and cautiously, we shall find that it is always so, and that even the errors to which we are all confessedly subject in no wise weaken the confidence that we naturally repose in each of our faculties.*</p><p name="9c79" id="9c79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 227. </strong>We are now able to answer our original question: What are the limits and characteristics of positive knowledge?

If we can proceed in this manner until we arrive at simple, self-evident propositions, we know that the original propositions are true. Thus, both by deduction from simple truths, and by a critical examination of credible assertions which constitute a portion of our own faith or of the general faith of our race, we are able to enlarge our sphere of knowledge, to replace probability by certainty, and determine the truth or falsehood of much that is involved in doubt.</p><p name="ac14" id="ac14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 229.</strong> Entire assurance, then, is attainable upon many points, but it can only be attained as the result of patient labor properly directed.

Upon the Thesis.<br />&quot; I have not sought after deceptions in these mutually contradictory<br />arguments in order, for instance (as it is termed), to advance an<br />advocate&#x27;s proof, who avails himself of the imprudence of his opponent<br />for his own advantage, and willingly sanctions his appeal to a<br />misunderstood law in order to establish his own unjust pretensions<br />upon the refutation of it. Each of these proofs is deduced from the<br />nature of things, and the advantage set aside which the erroneous<br />conclusions of Dogmatists could afford us on both parts.<br /><br />&quot; I might, likewise, have been able to demonstrate according to<br />appearance the Thesis, by reason of this, that I premised, agreeably<br />to the custom of the Dogmatists, an erroneous conception as to the<br />infinity of a given quantity. A quantity is infinite, beyond which no<br />greater (that is, beyond the therein contained multiplicity of a given<br />unity) is possible. Now, no multiplicity is the greatest, inasmuch as<br />always one or more unities can still be added thereto. Consequently an<br />infinite given quantity,-consequently, also (in respect of the elapsed<br />series as well as of extension), an infinite world is impossible. It is,<br />therefore, in both ways limited. I might, in such a way, have adduced my<br />proof; but this conception does not accord with that which we understand<br />by an infinite whole. It is not, thereby, represented so great as it is;<br />consequently, also, its conception is not the conception of a maximum, but<br />only, thereby, its relationship to an arbitrarily to be adopted unity is<br />thought, in respect of which this relationship is greater than all number.<br />Now, accordingly as unity is admitted greater or less, the infinite would<br />be greater or less; but infinity, as it consists merely in the relationship<br />to this given unity, would remain ever the same, although certainly the<br />absolute quantity of the whole thereby would not be at all known-but as<br />to which it is not here the question.<br /><br />&quot; The true (transcendental) conception of infinity is that the successive<br />synthesis of unity in the measurement of a Quantum can never be completed.*<br />Hence, it follows quite certainly that an eternity of real states following<br />upon one another can never have elapsed up to a given (the present) point of<br />time, - consequently, the world must have a beginning.<br /><br />&quot;In regard to the second part of the thesis, the difficulty certainly<br />disappears of an infinite and yet elapsed series, for the diversity of<br />an infinite world, as to extension, is given coexistently. But in order<br />to think the Totality of such a multiplicity, since we cannot appeal to<br />limits which constitute the totality in itself in the intuition, we must<br />render an account of our conception, which, in such a case, cannot go<br />from the whole to the determined multiplicity of the parts, but must<br />show the possibility of a whole by means of the successive synthesis of<br />the parts. And as this synthesis must form a never to be completed series,<br />we cannot thus think a totality prior to it (the synthesis), and<br />consequently, also, not through it. For this conception of totality<br />itself is, in this case, the representation of a completed synthesis of<br />parts, and this completion, and consequently the conception thereof, is<br />impossible.&quot;<br /><br />* &quot;This (the Quantum) thereby contains a multiplicity (of given unity),<br />which is greater than all number, which is the mathematical conception<br />of the infinite.&quot;<br /><br />&quot; OBSERVATION.<br /><br />&quot;2. Upon the Antithesis.<br />&quot;The proof of the infinity of the given cosmological series, and of the<br />cosmological Whole, rests upon this: that in the opposite case a void time<br />as well as a void space must constitute the limits of the world. Now, I<br />am not ignorant that against this consequence excuses are sought for,<br />inasmuch as it is pretended that there is a limit of the world in respect<br />of time and space quite possible, without its being even requisite to admit<br />an absolute time before the beginning of the world, or an absolute extended<br />space out of the real world, which is impossible. I am entirely satisfied<br />with the last part of this opinion of the philosophers of the Leibnitzian<br />school. Space is merely the form of the external intuition, but no real<br />object which can be envisaged externally, and no correlative of phenomena,<br />but the form of phenomena themselves. Space, therefore, cannot absolutely<br />(of itself alone) occur as something determining in the existence of things,<br />since it is no object at all, but only the form of possible objects. Things,<br />therefore, as phenomena, certainly determine space; that is, under all<br />possible predicates thereof (quantity and relationship), they so operate<br />that these or those belong to reality; but conversely, space, as something<br />which subsists of itself, cannot determine the reality of things in respect<br />of the quantity or form, because in itself it is nothing real. Consequently,<br />a space (whether full or void)* may very well be limited by phenomena, but<br />phenomena can never be limited by means of a void space external to them.<br />The same is also valid as to time. But all this being granted, it is still,<br />nevertheless, indubitable that we must absolutely admit two nonentities, void<br />space out of the world, and void time before the world, provided we admit a<br />limit to the world whether in respect of space or time.<br /><br />* &quot; It is easy to be observed, that hereby it is intended to say, that<br />void space so far as it is limited by phenomena--consequently that such<br />within the world does not, at least, contradict the transcendental<br />principles, and may, therefore, be admitted in respect of the same<br />(although its probability is not, on that account, directly maintained).<br /><br />&quot;For as to what regards the subterfuge whereby we strive to avoid the<br />consequence, agreeably to which we say that if the world (according to<br />time and space) has limits, the infinite void must determine the existence<br />of real things in respect of their quantity; it consists thus only in this,<br />that we think to ourselves instead of a sensible world, some sort of an<br />intellectual world, and instead of a first beginning (an existence previous<br />to which a time of non-being precedes), an existence generally is<br />imagined, which presupposes no other condition in the world, and instead<br />of boundaries of extension, limits are conceived of the universe, and<br />thereby avoidance is made of time and space. But here the question is<br />only as to mundus phcenomenon and its quantity, in respect of which we<br />can, by no means, make abstraction of the stated conditions of sensibility<br />without annihilating the being of it. The sensible world, if it be limited,<br />lies necessarily in the infinite void. If we will omit this, and consequently<br />space in general as condition of the possibility of phenomena a  priori,<br />the whole sensible world then disappears. In our problem this alone is<br />given us. The mundus intelligibilis is nothing but the universal<br />conception of a world in general, in which conception we make abstraction<br />of all conditions of the intuition of this world, and in respect of this<br />conception, no synthetic proposition, either affirmative or negative, is<br />possible.&quot;</span></pre></div></div></section><section name="e94a" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="e667" id="e667" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Chapter VIII.</h3><p name="37b4" id="37b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">EXAMINATION OF ANTINOMIES.</strong></p><p name="2838" id="2838" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 253.</strong> Tʜᴇ first ambiguity that presents itself in the foregoing antinomy, is in the meaning of the term “ world.” Kant says, “ The ideas with which we now concern ourselves I have before termed Cosmological ideas, partly on this account, because under world the complex of all phenomena is understood, and our ideas also are only directed to the unconditioned amongst phenomena;* partly, likewise, because the word world, in a transcendental sense, signifies the absolute totality of the complex of existing things, and we direct our attention alone to the completeness of the synthesis (although only strictly in the regressus to the conditions).” t The arguments of the Thesis are mainly based on ideas derived from the first of these definitions, and they have a quasi validity to show that the aggregate of phenomena (if the cause of the phenomena is excluded from consideration) may have had a beginning in time and a limit in space. The Antithesis can only be valid for the second definition to show that “the absolute totality of the complex of existing things” (including the Creative First Cause together with every possible and actual manifestation of His existence and power) must be, “as well in respect of time as of space, infinite.”</p><p name="e247" id="e247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 254.</strong> The second ambiguity is in the use of the word “infinite.” In the sense in which some philosophers have employed the terms infinite and finite, they are mutually contradictory, and it is as absurd to speak of their correlation as it would be to talk of the four sides and six angles of a square triangle. In one sense, the mere formation of an idea is limiting, inasmuch as it assigns bounds which distinguish the idea from all others, but according to customary usage, we have a right to call that infinite which is unlimited in one or more of its attributes.+ We have no right, however, to assume that what is true of one infinite is true of another, as is repeatedly done in each of the Kantian antinomies.</p><p name="e6f6" id="e6f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 255.</strong> In the celebrated sophism of Achilles and the tortoise,? there is a similar equivocal use of the ideas of infinity. “ The fallacy, as Hobbes hinted, lies in the tacit assumption that whatever is infinitely divisible is infinite. . . .

It means that we may divide a thousand feet by ten, and that quotient again by ten, and so on as often as we please; that there never needs be an end to the subdivisions of the distance, nor, consequently, to those of the time in which it is performed. But an unlimited number of subdivisions may be made of that which is itself limited. The argument proves no other infinity of duration than may be embraced within five minutes. As long as the five minutes are not expired, what remains of them may be divided by ten, and again by ten, as often as we like, which is perfectly compatible with their being only five minutes altogether.

It is quite true, as Kant remarks in his Observation upon the Thesis, “ that an eternity of real states following upon one another, can never have elapsed up to a given (the present) point of time,” provided we mean by eternity, duration that has neither beginning nor end, but our Thesis and Antithesis refer merely to the beginning, and it is quite certain that a terminated “succession of real states,” infinite in regard to its commencement, must have elapsed at every given point of time.</p><p name="8af1" id="8af1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 257.</strong> A third ambiguity arises from the equivocal meaning of space and time.

In each proposition, the term infinite is used with two or more meanings, and the different properties of different relative infinities, are contrasted with the supposed properties of a supposed absolute infinite. Hamilton himself points out this ambiguity in his letter to Mr. Henry Calderwood, in which he remarks, “that there is a fundamental difference between <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Infinite</em> (το ευ ξαι Παν), and a relation to which we may apply the term <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">infinite</em>.”* We can reason correctly about the relatively infinite, but not about, the absolutely infinite, which is devoid of all relation, even of the relations of unity, reality, and conceivability.†</p><p name="5c33" id="5c33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 263</strong>. Hamilton evidently uses the term conceivable in a narrower sense than many other philosophical writers, and I am inclined to believe that if his meaning were made perfectly clear, the truth of his Law of the Conditioned, “ that the conceivable is in every relation bounded by the inconceivable,” would be generally admitted. In the letter which has just been quoted, he says, “ What I have said as to the infinite being (subjectively) inconceivable, does not at all derogate from our belief of its (objective) reality. In fact, the main scope of my speculation is to show articulately that we <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">must believe </em>as actual, much that we are unable (positively) <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to conceive</em>, as even possible.’’‡ But when he says that “ though space must be admitted to be necessarily either finite or infinite, we are able to conceive the possibility neither of its finitude, nor of its infinity,” § he seems to be struggling with a perplexity that might have been avoided, if his ideas had been more clearly defined.</p><p name="2729" id="2729" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 264.</strong> Mill, in his Chapter on Fallacies of Simple Inspection, very properly controverts the proposition, that whatever is inconceivable must be false.

It was not surprising that the adherents of the old systems of astronomy should urge this objection against the new; but the false assumption imposed equally upon Newton himself, who in order to turn the edge of the objection, imagined a subtle ether which filled up the space between the sun and the earth, and by its intermediate agency was the proximate cause of the phenomena of gravitation. . . .</p><p name="18e7" id="18e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 266.</strong> “ No one now feels any difficulty in conceiving gravity to be, as much as any other property is, ‘innate, inherent, and essential to matter,’ nor finds the comprehension of it facilitated in the smallest degree by the supposition of an ether; nor thinks it at all incredible that the celestial bodies can and do act where they, in actual bodily presence, are not.

The general reception of the undulatory theory proves that every “ educated person in Europe” and elsewhere still feels the necessity of endeavoring to account for all transmission of force, and still believes that “ a thing cannot act where it is not” in the sense in which Newton probably believed the maxim, though it is doubtful whether any one ever believed it in the sense that Mill disputes.</p><p name="ab3f" id="ab3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 270.</strong> In like manner the remaining propositions about matter, space, and creation can, undoubtedly, be so defined that their <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a priori</em> self-evidence may be doubted or even denied.

Whenever any line of argument appears to lead to a paradox, it may safely be inferred that Reason has either left her own province or that she has become confused by some hidden equivocation.

The results of the two processes will naturally differ, but the difference should not be irreconcilable, and philosophy can never make much progress until a reconciliation is effected. “Aristotle attempted a synthesis of things in their multiplicity, — a classification of objects real, but in relation to thought; — Kant, an analysis of mind in its unity, — a dissection of thought, pure, but in relation to its objects. The predicaments of Aristotle are thus objective, of things as understood; those of Kant subjective, of the mind as understanding.

The method of Aristotle was nearly perfected by its author; and for more than two thousand years, his disciples have endeavored in vain to extend or improve his system. The method of Kant was merely initial, and the revival of philosophy during the past century has shown that it was productive. It has the advantage of starting from that which is best known, the subjective, in its endeavors to learn the unknown, while Aristotle started from the objective, of which he was obliged to assume a reality for which he had only subjective evidence.</p><p name="082a" id="082a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">336</strong>. Without attempting to harmonize the objective and subjective categories, without even endeavoring to give the best philosophical explanation of the basis on which either of them rests, — it may reasonably be expected that a subjective symbolism should at least show a possible mode, if not the best mode, of accounting for Kant’s empirical arrangement of the subjective categories. Let us see with what success we can deduce them from the relations of the primitive forms of Consciousness.</p><p name="7d13" id="7d13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">337</strong>. All analysis proceeds from the general to the particular that is embraced under it. Our highest general idea of the mind, is the idea of Consciousness, and the first question that suggests itself for our analysis is, How does Consciousness regard the objects of its cognition, or in what different modes can it consider them? The answer will naturally be sought in accordance with the conditions of Motivity, Spontaneity, and Rationality.</p><p name="767d" id="767d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">338</strong>. Motivity, although it refers to objects exterior to ourselves, cannot immediately give us those objects. It relates only to phenomena, and to the influence of those phenomena on our own minds. If, for example, I receive a sensation of solidity, or heat, or color, the sensation is entirely subjective; it belongs exclusively to myself, and not to the body, to which Motivity refers as its cause. I cannot, therefore, merely as receptive, assert the reality of anything objective; the most I can do is to admit its Possibility.</p><p name="b4ad" id="b4ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">339</strong>. Spontaneity, being exclusively subjective in its action as well as its reference, is entirely valid in all its determinations. I know absolutely all that I feel, wish, do, or think, and hence I derive a consciousness superior to the mere possibility of the Motivity a consciousness of Reality. My own reality is more evident than that of any being out of myself, and the highest reality to which I can attain is, therefore, that of a Spontaneous Intelligence.</p><p name="5c05" id="5c05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">340</strong>. Rationality decides not only with unvarying uniformity from the data that are given it, but it does so with the full conviction that it would be impossible for any intelligent being to decide otherwise from the same data. In viewing the possibility of Motivity, it decides that there must necessarily be. an external objective cause of all our external impressions; it seeks in the reality of the subjective Spontaneity a necessary object for its consideration; and it conjoins the idea of necessity with all its determinations, thus completing the circle of our modes of thought.</p><p name="db94" id="db94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">341</strong>. Consciousness, therefore, in the three conditions of intelligence, gives us the three categories of Modality, — Possibility, Reality, and Necessity, all of which refer to General Science.</p><p name="d0a0" id="d0a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 342.</strong> Subjecting the several mental states in turn to the same kind of analysis, our next inquiries must be: How do Motivity, Spontaneity, Rationality regard the objects of their cognition? We will seek the answers by the same clue that we adopted in the case of Consciousness.</p><p name="5fb6" id="5fb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">343</strong>. A passive and comparatively quiet state of mind is the earliest, the easiest, and perhaps the most common at all periods of life. The facts of Motivity are therefore the most evident, the most generally admitted, and the most readily understood. Motivity is emphatically the faculty of childhood or pupilage; and all its teachings are received with the implicit faitl of the child and pupil.</p><p name="6b14" id="6b14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">344</strong>. All our impressions are susceptible of increase or diminution. Hence through Motivity we readily obtain the idea of Quantity.</p><p name="9dd4" id="9dd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">345</strong>. All the imnpressions of mere Motivity are single and momentary. Merely as receptive beings, we neither distinguish parts of objects nor unite different impressions together. If we feel, our sensation is a unit,-merely a feeling, and nothing more; if we see, we see an object as a unit, and so with every impression on the senses. It is merely the impression that is cognized through Motivity, and the category of Motivity, cognizing its own impressions, is, therefore, Unity.</p><p name="f786" id="f786" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">346</strong>. Spontaneity unites several determinations in its own consciousness. It embraces the faculty of attention, and applying itself to the determinations of Motivity, it can attend successively to all the parts of an object or of an impression, and derive the idea of plurality from unity. The category of Spontaneity, cognizing the impressions of Motivity, is, therefore, Plurality.</p><p name="c6d1" id="c6d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">347</strong>. The office of Rationality is, as we have seen, to cognize and compare the representations of the other intellectual conditions. Applying itself to the determinations of Motivity, it will therefore recognize both the receptive unity and the spontaneous plurality, and from their relation will derive the category of Totality, in which Unity and Plurality are both combined.</p><p name="ab24" id="ab24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">348</strong>. Motivity, therefore, in the three conditions of intelligence, gives us the three categories of Quantity, Unity, Plurality, and Totality, all of which refer, through the motive category of Modality, to the Science of the Possible, and particularly to Mathematical Science.</p><p name="0a18" id="0a18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">349</strong>. Next in order of prominence as well as of acquisition, are the determinations of Spontaneity. The subject cannot regard itself otherwise than as object, and there is there- fore more difficulty attending the study of the purely subjective, than we have found in the objective, as manifested through Motivity.</p><p name="3190" id="3190" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">350</strong>. Spontaneity is the active, laboring state of the mind, corresponding to the vigor of youth and early manhood. In investigatino its laws, one of the first inquiries is, What influence do we have by our voluntary action over the objects of our cognition, or what quality do we communicate to them?</p><p name="0242" id="0242" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">351</strong>. All impressions of Spontaneity on Motivity, are real or affirmative. We have, in- deed, no power of limitation or of negation, as mere receptive beings, but we assert fully and positively, every impression that we receive. Thus, we can never admit that the senses deceive us, for the senses are merely media for conveying impressions. We exercise our attention or spontaneity, together with our senses or motive-rationality, and an impression follows. the reality of which is undoubted. A further effort of spontaneity is required to interpret the meaning of that impression, and if that secondary effort is insufficient, we are led into error. The category of Motivity, cognizing the impressions of Spontaneity, is therefore Affirmation.</p><p name="2ad4" id="2ad4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">352</strong>. The peculiar office of Spontaneity, particularly when concerned with its own actions, or with Reality, of which its actions are the representatives, is to define, limit, and give precision to our ideas.</p><p name="9915" id="9915" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">353</strong>. We have seen that what are called delusions of the senses, are properly errors of spontaneity. I have, for example, the impression of an object on the optic nerve. Of the reality of tlle impression there can be no doubt, but great care may be necessary to give it its proper interpretation. I must first inquire whether the impression is occasioned by a disease of the nerve, or by the normal stimulus of an external object. If I am satisfied tllat it proceeds from an outward object, I must then attend to the angles of vision which determine the outline, the modulations of light and shade that indicate the form, the dis- tinctness or indistinctness that mark its relative nearness or distance, and enable me to judge of its size, the clearness or haziness of the atmosphere, sharpness or obscurity of vision, and any other circumstances that may affect my decision. A failure of proper attention in any of these limiting particulars, may be the source of error. The category of Spontaneity, cognizing its own action, is therefore Limitation.</p><p name="c6ae" id="c6ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">354</strong>. Rationality, comparing the receptive affirmation and the spontaneous limitation, can alone set impassable limits, and give us the category of Negation. The child, in be- ginning to gratify his desire for knowledge, accepts everything that is told him with implicit faith. It is only after Rationality has acquired considerable development, that he begins to doubt or deny.</p><p name="ab29" id="ab29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">355</strong>. Spontaneity, therefore, in the three conditions of intelligence, gives us the three categories of Quality,-Affirmation, Limitation, and Negation; all of which refer, through the spontaneous category of Modality, to the science of Reality, or Existence, and particularly to Natural Science.</p><p name="398e" id="398e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">356</strong>. Rationality is not only the highest of our faculties, but it is the latest developed, and the most rarely found in full development. It holds the same rank in the human mind that man himself occupies in the created world, and as reasoning beings are superior to beings of impulse and instinct, so is the reasoning man, the man who seeks and loves the true and perfect, superior to the man of appetite aid passion.</p><p name="a98e" id="a98e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">357</strong>. A thorough investigation of Rationality is therefore, as we might naturally suppose, and as we shall find in the pursuit of our inquiries, attended with greater difficulties than the study of Motivity or Spontaneity. Some of these difficulties are indeed insurmount- able by finite and progressive beings, for from its very nature, reason requires the perfect and infinite for its full satisfaction. So long, therefore, as there is any leaven of imperfec- tion in us, we can only approximate nearer and nearer to its ends, without ever attaining them.</p><p name="1ec2" id="1ec2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">358</strong>. The first step in our progress, the investigation of the rational categories, is, how- ever, comparatively easy, guided as we may be by thle results we have already obtained. We need onily inquire (since the objective becomes ideally represented to us only through Relation), What are Motivity, Spontaneity, and Rationality, and what relations do they severally indicate?</p><p name="1669" id="1669" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">359</strong>. Motivity, as we have seen, refers merely to phenomena, from which we obtain ideas of the accidental qualities of bodies. Rationality asserts the necessity of some reality in which those qualities inhere. The category of Motivity in Rationality is, therefore, that of Inherence and Subsistence, or Substance and Accident.</p><p name="3416" id="3416" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">360</strong>. Spontaneity is the faculty of action. Rationality assions the negative limit to action, which is reaction. The relation of the two gives us the category of Spontaneity in Rationality, which is that of Action and Reaction.</p><p name="21fc" id="21fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">361</strong>. Rationality, as will be more evident lie hereafter, is the faculty of Cause. The correlative of cause is effect. The same relation is easily discovered by comparing the two preceding categories. The category of Rationality in Rationality is, therefore, that of Cause and Effect.</p><p name="63ba" id="63ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">362</strong>. Rationality, therefore, in the three conditions of intelligence, gives us the three categories of Relation: Substance and Accident, Action and Reaction, and Cause and Effect, all of which refer, through the rational category of Modality, to the science of the Necessary, and particularly to Metaphysical Science.</p><p name="13dc" id="13dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">363</strong>. The twelve categories thus deduced, correspond with the categories of Kant, except in the arrangement of the subdivisions of Quality and Relation. Kant could discover no reason for his arrangement, or for the precise number of categories that he pro- pounded,* but his mind was eminently analytical, and proceeding in strict accordance with the necessary laws of analysis, his researches were crowned with a success nearly as complete, as if he had fully perceived the dependence of the result upon those laws. Per-haps in no portion of his great works is his genius more evident, than in his development of the laws of perceptive unity, with no other guides than his own discernment, and the meagre clue afforded by the categories of Aristotle.</p><p name="32fb" id="32fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">364</strong>. So far as the categories are the representatives of ideas that we have received, they belong to our Motivity, and therefore have an objective reference as to their origin. If we apply them to the subject through Spontaneity, or to general judgments tlhrough Rationality, they undergo a formal modification that can be readily discerned.</p><p name="c806" id="c806" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">365</strong>. If we represent the judgment forms by means of symbols, their mutual relation and deduction will be more evident, and the defects of our nomenclature, whatever they may be, will disappear in the symbolic formula. In the following table, X is the symbol of the categorical or rational forms; Y of the subjective or spontaneous; Z of the conditional or motive.

Principle and Idea are used synonymously by many writers, but as they are made to include existence under both subjective-objective and objective-subjective relations, it is desirable that the difference of relations should be indicated by different names.</p><p name="5bda" id="5bda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 427.</strong> If we adopt as objective symbols, P for Principle, E for Essence, and I for Idea, the subdivisions of the next lower plane may be thus represented:</p><figure name="d888" id="d888" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*J3jQ_6GjT2pM-jK4vKnTDw.png" data-width="2083" data-height="283" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J3jQ_6GjT2pM-jK4vKnTDw.png"></figure><p name="51ce" id="51ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 428.</strong> The relations that are represented by the symbols, are unchangeable, but the names are merely proposed for consideration.

Let us examine a few of the formulas that have been devised for the expression of this almost universal creed of humanity, in order to ascertain, if possible, the precise extent of the truth that it represents.</p><p name="999a" id="999a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 441.</strong> Aɴᴀxɪᴍᴀɴᴅᴇʀ. “The original essence which he assumed, and which he is said to have been the first to have named principle (adp), he defined as the ‘ unlimited, eternal, and unconditioned,’ as that which embraced all things, and ruled all things, and which, since it lay at the basis of all determinations of the finite and the changeable, is itself infinite and undeterminate.”</p><p name="4b0e" id="4b0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 442.</strong> Aʀɪsᴛᴏᴛʟᴇ. “Hence the famed Aristotelian definition of the Absolute, that it is the thought of thought (&lt;GREEK TERM&gt;), the personal unity of the thinking and the thought, of the knowing and the known, the absolute subject-object.

This belief in a Spirit of Order, little as it is grounded on demonstration, yet depends directly upon the same conclusions, and has the same certainty as the belief by which every man is convinced of the existence of other rational spirits; for of my fellow-men I see only forms and teleological acts, and that these proceed from rational thought is only a belief, but one so worthy of confidence that it stands in certainty above all knowledge.”</p><p name="32a8" id="32a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">—</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">444.</strong> Sᴄʜᴇʟʟɪɴɢ. “ To bring Realism and Idealism into a state of reciprocal penetration, such has been the declared object of all my endeavors.

Therefore, every thought, even that which is now rough and crude, merits attention so soon as it tends towards the simplifying of principles, and if it serves no other end, it at least strengthens the impulse to investigate and trace out the hidden process of nature.’ The special tendency of the scientific investigation of nature which prevailed at that time, was to make a duality of forces the predominant element in the life of nature. ….In opposition to these dualities, Schelling now insisted upon the unity of everything opposite, the unity of all dualities, and this not simply as an abstract unity, but as a concrete identity, as the harmonious co-working of the heterogeneous.”*</p><p name="1075" id="1075" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 446.</strong> “How is it possible that our thought should ever rule over the world of sense, if the representation is conditioned in its origin by the objective ?

These determinate states, modes, and forms, . . . . are not to be separated from the essence, but to every present appearance there must be at bottom a real or essential element, or, to use the expression of Herbart, for every appearance there must be a real to which the former points.”+</p><p name="c0b1" id="c0b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 448.</strong> “ We thus arrive as a result at the Aristotelian w6rit Poer go?,; the self-thinking process of thought, or the self-knowing truth, Absolute Idealism, which in itself is absolute realism, or an identity in which those antagonisms have coalesced, in order to generate or engender themselves anew, without positing therewith a duplicity of principles; seeing that the production of the antagonismns, or, to speak more concisely, the powers of self-opposition or absolute negativity, is the one absolutely self-moving principle.”?</p><p name="cdad" id="cdad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 449.</strong> Hamilton, as we have seen, uses the term Absolute to denote what is “finished, perfected, completed; in which sense the Absolute will be what is out of relation, &amp;c., as finished, perfect, complete, total.” “ In this acceptation . . . the Absolute is diametrically opposed to, is contradictory of, the Infinite.” He also speaks of the Unconditioned as “the genus of which the Infinite and Absolute are species,” and says that “ the Absolute and Infinite are conceived only as negations of the conditioned in its opposite poles.” || We have already examined some. of the contradictions in which, by his own admission, these definitions necessarily involved their author, and those necessary contradictions might be reasonably assumed as sufficient evidence of error. But even without regard to the consequences of the definitions, what can be “‘ the opposite pole” to the Infinite or Unlimited if it be not the Finite or Limited ? The limited must be conditioned by its limits, — therefore the unconditionally limited is an absurdity.

If of the two correlations, the finite and infinite, either is unknown, is it not the finite. The infinite is wholly independent of any subjective relation or coloring, but the finite is apprehended only under the subjective relations which we assign it, and it may plausibly be regarded as merely a subjective notion, destitute of any objective reality. The Infinite and Unconditioned are certainly objects of thought, and though we may know nothing more of them (as we know nothing more of mind and matter), than their relative manifestations, we may know that there is something more in them. Though we cannot identify ourselves with the Absolute in reality, may we not cognize it under ideal relations?

We admit to Sir William that the knowledge which we have been describing, and the knowledge of the Infinite, which we intend to describe at still greater length, is an indefinite knowledge. But it is an indefinite knowledge of what? Of this: It is an indefinite knowledge of an infinite object. It is not a knowledge of the finite, for we can find no limits; according to our own consciousness, and according to Sir William’s statement, it is an indefinite knowledge of something; therefore it is an indefinite knowledge of the infinite. We profess nothing but an indefinite knowledge, but it must be a knowledge of something, and as not of the finite, it must be of the infinite. Sir William’s argument we consider valid, if viewed as a refutation of the assertion that we have a clear and definite knowledge of the Infinite. But, on the other hand, Sir William maintains for himself that we can have no knowledge of the Infinite. This conclusion we consider no more valid than the other, for it does not follow that, since we have not a clear and definite knowledge of the Infinite, therefore we can have no knowledge of it at all ….. While it is true that the finite mind cannot have infinite thoughts, we hold it equally true that the finite mind can have finite thoughts concerning an infinite object. … In so far as Sir William maintains that we cannot have a clear knowledge of the Infinite in all its extent; and in so far as M.

And although the principles of correct philosophizing will not allow us to assume their essential identity until it is more fully demonstrated, the same natural instinct of Reason that has enabled us to approach so nearly to a unity of force, compels us to mount still higher, until we attain to the conception of the Necessary, Supreme Being, who is absolutely knowable, so far as the reality of His existence is concerned, and at the same time absolutely incomprehensible, and only faintly shadowed forth under such relations as He sees fit to employ in His revelation to His intelligent creatures.</p><p name="9bee" id="9bee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 458.</strong> But while Reason thus ascends through the analogies of Spontaneity to the Greatest, and after the successive abstraction of all subordinate relations, finally abstracts relation itself, and thus forms the conception of the Absolute, there are other needs of our nature that equally demand supreme satisfaction.

Philosophy, resting on revelation, may use all the facts and teachings of faith as the materials of its deductions, and it should verify its results by comparing them with the well-recognized truths of revelation. By making such a comparison, it will ascertain that there is not only an Absolute, which is in itself entirely independent of all external relation, and therefore entirely aloof from all possible human conception, except in the mere idea of Existence, but that there is also an Aʙsᴏʟᴜᴛᴇ-Rᴇʟᴀᴛɪᴠᴇ, which has voluntarily placed itself in relation with its works.<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">*</strong></p><p name="30c0" id="30c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 461.</strong> Only under the conception of such an Absolute-Relative is it possible for us to believe in a Divine Love that works teleologically for benevolent purposes, — a Divine Activity, “ upholding all things by the word of His power,” — a Divine Wisdom by which all things were made, — and thus to form some idea, however feeble it may be, of that ineffable Divine Image in which man was created. Only under such a conception can we understand that in our ascent to the Absolute, we can never overstep that Highest Unity, which is at once Knowing and Known, and that the atheistical notion of a blind fate, an unreasoning power, an unintelligent “order of nature,” is opposed to the plainest deductions of reason, as well as to the teachings of revelation. Only under such a conception can we feel that man has not been created in vain, — that all the needs of our toiling, struggling, suffering race, have been provided with the means of satisfaction, — that the Infinite Creator is “not a God afar off,” but that He is “Our Father” in heaven, with more than a father’s sympathy and love, — “the Lord merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.”</p><p name="c3eb" id="c3eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— 462.</strong> Under this conception, what a halo of glorious beauty is thrown around the Christian Revelation!

The charity that, in the midst of the agony in the garden, forgave the weakness of the heavy-eyed disciples, will ever continue to inspire erring humanity with the hope of forgiveness, for the consequences of its own feebleness and imperfection. The great mystery of all mysteries, — God the Incarnate Word, by whom all things were made, who came unto His own, and His own received Him not, in whom was life, and the life was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, is at once a revealed evidence, and a philosophical consequence of the mediating relativity of the Absolute. Here, then, may baffled speculation, which in its endeavors to grasp the unrelated Infinite, has laid a vain oblation on the altar of “the unknown God,” at length find satisfaction, and bow reverently and thankfully as it hears the voice of the once persecuting, but afterwards converted and zealous apostle, proclaiming to the philosophers of all time, as well as to the “too-superstitious”

When men understand each other, they always agree in what they knoto, and they either harmonize in belief, or perceive that they would do so if they occupied the same standpoint.</li><li name="d1d5" id="d1d5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">* “If we appeal to consciousness, consciousness gives, even in the last analysis, in the unity of knowledge, a duality of existence.” Hamilton, Discussions, p. 66. “ The necessary condition of intelligence is consciousness, that is, difference.” Cousin, Hist. of Mod. Phil., Vol. I, p. 88. We are apt to imagine, in the progress of philosophical investigations, that we discover a number of necessary but independent unities or realities, such as space, time, position, &amp;c.; but a searching analysis will demonstrate that they are all merely forms of the knowable, standing in relation to our capacities of knowing, and that whatever necessity we may discover for their existence, is evidence of the necessary existence of a still higher unity. If the essentiality and permanence of this duality, as well as its dependence on “the necessary condition of intelligence,” is fully appreciated, Mahan’s forcible statement of one of the strongest arguments in favor of im- mortality (p. 435), will seemn almost axiomatic. “At death, not a particle of the physical organization, with which the soul is here connected, perishes. How unreasonable and absurd the supposition, that the soul, for which all else was made, is the only reality that then ceases to be.”</li></ul></div></div></section><section name="82a1" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="5c03" id="5c03" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Definitions &amp; Etymologies for Pliny Chase’s Words</h3><pre data-code-block-mode="2" spellcheck="false" data-code-block-lang="plaintext" name="94f0" id="94f0" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--h3 graf--trailing graf--preV2"><span class="pre--content">An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (1721)<br />Johnson&#x27;s A Dictionary of the English Language (1755)<br />Webster&#x27;s Dictionary (1828)<br />Worcester&#x27;s Dictionary<br />Richardson&#x27;s New Dictionary<br />Imperial Dictionary (1847–1850)<br />Century Dictionary (1889–1891)<br /><br />Greek-Latin Dictionaries.<br />Thesaurus Graecae Linguae Henri Estienne 1572<br />Kritisches griechisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch Johann Gottlob Schneider 1797 (German)  <br />Handwörterbuch der griechischen Sprache Franz Passow 1819 4th 1831 (German)<br />Griechisch-Deutsches Handwörterbuch Wilhelm Pape 1842 (German)<br />A Greek–English Lexicon Liddell, Scott, Jones, McKenzie 1843 English<br /><br />Latin Etymology.<br />Michiel de Vaan.
